      "Acquisition focus": "Melbourne High School commenced as the Melbourne Continuation School in Spring Street Melbourne in 1905. It was the first state secondary school in Victoria and was co-educational. It was renamed Melbourne High School in 1910. The boys moved to Forrest Hill, South Yarra in 1927 and the girls eventually moved to Albert Park and became MacRobertson Girls' High School. The collection is mainly post-1927 but does have significant records relating to the 1905-1927 period. The collection does NOT include MacRobertson Girls' High School records."

      "Major holdings": "Full student registers, most student reports, school publications (such as: 'Ours' and 'Unicorn') as well as a large photographic collection. The school archives are mainly in-house but will accept relevant documents, photographs and memorabilia from former students and staff."
